Her eyes sparkled with wonder as the warm gleam of iridescent lights illuminated her path. Gazing ahead she caught sight of a dream shimmering on the horizon...

The first gate opened with a loud thunderous sound.

Instantly, she found herself admiring the space above her body as the passageway that took her there vanished faster than it  had first appeared.

All kinds of lights were flashing and spinning around going everywhere and nowhere at the same time.

Entire worlds filled with sacred geometry opened and closed before her eyes. 

Each time she noticed her body grew further and further away from earth until it dissolved and collapsed into nothingness.

Her new essence seemed weightless and free to expand through the entire range of existence all at once.

Was this all just a dream?

She struggled a bit to make sense of what was transpiring before her. 

Emi had heard about this moment many times when the elders spoke. Her memories were fading away but she could still hear the voices talking.

"Do not go into the light! For the light is but a trick on the mind."

"Beyond that light the eternal beings will deceive you and make you walk into the tunnel that leads back to the same beginning."

"They are tricksters out to fool us."

"Start again. Start again. They chant as your life is replayed on the big screen."

"Foolery!"

"They will flush your mind and recycle your energy body if you are not careful."

"You must remain aware. Do not move forward."

Emi remembered all the sacred teachings she had received and with a concentrated effort she managed to circumnavigate out of harm's way.

Everything on earth below seemed like just a faint pixelated memory now.
