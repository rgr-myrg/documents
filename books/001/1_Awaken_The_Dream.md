Her eyes sparkled with wonder as the warm gleam of iridescent lights illuminated her path. Gazing ahead she caught sight of a dream shimmering on the horizon...

The first gate opened with a loud thunderous sound.

Instantly, she found herself admiring the space above her body as the passageway that took her there dissipated faster than it  had first appeared.

Emi had heard about this moment many times when the elders spoke.

"Do not go into the light! For the light is but a trick on the mind."

"Beyond that light the eternal beings will deceive you and make you walk into the tunnel that leads back to the same beginning."

"They are tricksters out to fool us."

"Start again. Start again. They chant as your life is replayed on the big screen."

"Foolery!"

And they walked holding hands following the path to the Light.
