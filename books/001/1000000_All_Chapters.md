Awaken The Dream

Her eyes sparkled with wonder as the warm gleam of iridescent lights illuminated her path. Gazing ahead she caught sight of a dream shimmering on the horizon...

The first gate opened with a loud thunderous sound.

Instantly, she found herself admiring the space above her body as the passageway that took her there vanished faster than it  had first appeared.

All kinds of lights were flashing and spinning around going everywhere and nowhere at the same time.

Entire worlds filled with sacred geometry opened and closed before her eyes. 

Each time she noticed her body grew further and further away from earth until it dissolved and collapsed into nothingness.

Her new essence seemed weightless and free to expand through the entire range of existence all at once.

Was this all just a dream?

She struggled a bit to make sense of what was transpiring before her. 

Emi had heard about this moment many times when the elders spoke. To experience this new realm by herself, however, was just too intense.

Her memories were fading away but she could still hear the voices talking.

"Do not go into the light! For the light is but a trick on the mind."

"Beyond that light the eternal beings will deceive you and make you walk into the tunnel that leads back to the same beginning."

"They are tricksters out to fool us."

"Start again. Start again. They chant as your life is replayed on the big screen."

"Foolery!"

"They will flush your mind and recycle your energy body if you are not careful."

"You must remain aware. Do not move forward."

Emi remembered all the sacred teachings she had received and with a concentrated effort she managed to circumnavigate out of harm's way.

Everything on earth below seemed like just a faint pixelated memory now.

Imagine The Light

Eons ago the sunlight bathed the surface of the entire planet. 

Brilliant indigo auroras waved over the mountains while the mist of a distant waterfall gave way to rainbows high above the rocks.

Blue whales swam on crystal oceans under the deep sky at dawn as hundreds of stars lighted the heavens above. Lush vegetation sprung to life everywhere.

All were consciously in touch with the Universe. Time and prosperity seemed boundless.

The glow of the light permeated every corner of our heavenly body creating music, powering the force of the winds and oceans, and providing abundant energy to all beings large and small.

It must have taken hundreds of years before Huma eventually overpowered and conquered the land by blending day and night into darkness and consuming our memories for sustenance; in the process becoming stronger and stronger with each iteration. 

Many believed humanity itself summoned the archon to emerge from its shadowy state of suspended animation into the light of our world. Our technological advancements had blurred the boundaries between the natural and artificial and soon reached a point of no return. 

The veil between the world above and the frozen realms below would cave in and burst open as the shadow that came into being beneath the veil solidified into dense matter. 

In hindsight, humanity was willingly complicit in its own breakdown.

No one heeded the warning signs. With time our thinking became murky and confused. Our reasoning faltered. Our hopes for survival shattered into fragmented dreams as the pathogen affixed itself into the very core of our being changing us and human history forever. 

Our way of life had been under attack and yet no war had ever been declared.

No one could foresee how that which was touted as progress and limitless power would also become humanity's pitfall and weakness. How easily and steadfastly promises of human transformation and evolutionary breakthrough could backfire and instead replicate themselves like viruses that gradually replace its host's thoughts with their own - unbeknownst to the host. 

Such powers of deception in the end almost finished off humanity for good. After all, if all you believe is true, how can you deny your own thoughts and words?  

Huma had triumphantly entered into our collective consciousness. 

The Monument

Central Heights is the largest historic neighborhood in Harbordotem, stretching easterly across the promenade and alongside narrow avenues. It is the oldest neighborhood in Harbordotem with roughly 5,000 residents.

One of the core characteristics of Central Heights is constant change, in fact, the entire neighborhood has been in continuous development since the early days. 

Despite unstoppable progress, tearing down the old and rebuilding the state-of-the-art structures seen today, there are many remarkably well preserved areas with historic buildings and winding streets which provide a sharp contrast to the daily hustle-and-bustle and high energy distinctive of this part of town.

Today, Central Heights straddles two quadrants of Harbordotem city, Northbridge and Southbridge, and a large portion of it is designated as the governing district of the entire city. New Memorial Monument is tucked away and nestled among the high energy walls of government buildings situated in this part of town. 

With all the renovations, new features, and media attention surrounding the monument, it quickly became our most treasured and most frequented landmark, and the most famous reminder of the grandiosity of our previous blue planet. To this day, New Memorial Monument is by far the most accurate representation of where we all had lived once upon a time. 

Visitors strolling by on foot often stop to admire the view and catch a high resolution glimpse of the world that once was. Anyone can jump in and interact with the immersive simulation but never directly experience the true beauty of our former world. 

The Elders

Emi was holding onto the railing as tightly as she could. Still clutching the flat and folded leaflet she had snatched on her way out of Memorial Plaza in one hand and balancing her weight with the other as the cabin wobbled over bumpy turbulence. She glanced quickly with focused attention at the printed photo of the monument whenever the hexa-mobile jolted down to a slower pace and started moving fast again. 

What a rich and contrasting planet we all had lived in. Luminous and ethereal. Peaceful and full of colors. In comparison our current world seemed bleak and one dimensional like pale drawings on a flat canvas sketched in charcoal. Like remnants of burnt organic material squeezed down and neatly fixed into fine lines. 

"This world is a monochromatic and deflated arrangement of sorts." Emi's grandfather had mentioned numerous times.

She still remembered trips to the desert she had taken as a child with her Awki. Oh how she cherished those moments and wished her grandfather  was still with her. 

Awki had showed Emi ancient petroglyphs etched in rocks and caves while on their many hikes through the desert. 

"Messages across time and space", he had told her. 

"Our Elders astutely carved archetypes in the form of pictograms into the rock and left us a record of their long journeys and  prophecies... and of the spiral creation."

"These same archetypes can be found carved into rocks all over the world."

"Prophecy Rock, Oraibi. Sego Canyon, Utah. Val Camonica, Italy. Queretaro, Mexico. Los Tayos, Ecuador. Tassili n'Ajjer, Sahara Desert, North Africa. Wandjina petroglyphs from Kimberley, Australia. India, Java, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Algeria, Tanzania, West Africa, and Dogon cave paintings of the Nommo who came in huge ships from the sky; to name a few."

The list was extensive.

"Look there! Do you see it?"

"Focus there! On the underside of that huge boulder straight up ahead."

"See the spiral glyph up there?"

"The spiral form is not coincidental! It's mathematical. Logarithmic in nature!" Awki was yelling as they both sprinted ahead wildly. Their leg muscles already burning with anticipation. 

She could feel the energy pulling her body intensely towards the glyph.  The spiral curve emanating from a single point on the rock, moving her farther and farther away from Awki as it revolved around her center point and tugged away at her core. Her feet now dashing at top speed like the paws of a lioness in motion. Emi was light and graceful.

Awki knew in his heart she was born to run.

By the time he caught up with Emi, she was already tracing the spirals on the rock with her fingers. Her hands seemed to flow back and forth in constant circular motion perpetually in sync with the universe. Her eyes gazed with a soft focus.
 
â€œDid the Elders build the pyramids too?â€ Emi asked. 

â€œThe ones in Egypt do you mean?â€

â€œYeah. Those.â€

â€œThe pyramids in Egypt were built by the Watchers using primitive technology. They basically casted each block in situ. They were proficient at linear algebra and trigonometry not unlike their predecessors the Mayans but not as spiritually gifted.â€

â€œThey showed up later in our timeline in the form of Egyptian elites and tried to enslave humanity but werenâ€™t successful. The Elders are much more ancient than the Watchers and the Mayans.â€

â€œWhat did the Elders build then?â€ Emi wanted to know.

Awki smiled. â€œLook to giant structures with impressive gateways scattered around the globe.â€

â€œLook for the ones built with monumental proportions. Some were assembled on platforms, courts, or artificial mounds like the Gateway to The Sun. Most of these structures are still buried deep underground.â€

â€œTiwanaku!â€ Emiâ€™s eyes were attentive and wide open now.

She was already discerning and actively committing Awkiâ€™s descriptions of places to memory. She always treated it as a game: match the description to the name place in under 3 seconds. 

â€œOne, twoâ€¦ three!â€

Three seconds was the longest time Awki would go without explaining.

â€œSearch the area around Tiwanaku for huge blocks of stone bound so tightly to each other with internal metal alloy staples. Not a single pin can penetrate the joints.â€

â€œThere are tablets with symbols there we cannot decipher to this day. They may be algorithms,  scientific formulas, or clues for the survival of our civilization. â€ 

Awki was getting ahead of himself and paused for a bit. 

â€œWe just donâ€™t know for sure.â€ He continued.

â€œFor this reason the Elders, though highly advanced, decided to carve basic archetypes into rocks. They hoped humanity would understand simpler concepts.â€

â€œThey hoped we would get the message they laid out for us hidden in plain sight.â€

He always felt he was coming close to cracking the code on many ancient artifacts and tablets previously undecipherable and tossed aside as â€œartâ€ or completely dismissed by mainstream archeology. Most of these objects seemingly out of place from our timeline were not. Perhaps there was another timeline.

In any case, a few more jumps and he should be able to complete his mission of solving one of humanityâ€™s oldest mysteries or perhaps completely rewriting human history.

A few more jumps and he would finally decode the Eldersâ€™ Pictogram language as well as master Ancient Hebrew, Classical Latin, Cuneiform, and Proto-Sanskrit. 

â€œThe functional programming language of the ancients.â€ 

â€œThe complete picture.â€ He thought to himself.

Jump v1.0

Awki had been a highly respected architect, historian, and archeologist and part of the original team in charge of preserving and recreating milestones in human history complete with landscapes and important landmarks. His team had single-handedly architected and developed the ubiquitous Jump platform that brought amazing experiences to the new world.

“A fully immersive platform for experiencing Earth as never before.”

“Explore history from a totally personal perspective and discover first-hand the incredible sites and richness of the blue planet.”

“Jump Immersive Reality delivers the whole world within your reach.”

“Jump Anywhere.”

Jump v1.0 eventually achieved complete realism. Users could jump to a mod of their choice and immerse themselves into scenes indistinguishable from waking reality. It was the first simulation of its kind. Loaded with features that allowed users to interact with inhabitants of the simulation as if they were indeed real.

Fearing misuse the government restricted programming of scenes and mods only to those with top secret security clearance.

[Explain Jump in depth.]

Command Control

One day, special agents from Command Control arrived at her father’s residence to inform him Awki was missing and a find-and-rescue operation had been launched. Emi’s father requested control agents to put him through the Central Unit to expedite the search. He repeatedly argued, to no avail, the search operation was disjointed and Command Control was short in resources not to mention out of jurisdiction in their execution. 

It was customary for control agents to call on the Central Unit when necessary but for various reasons this operation was restricted and Emi’s father did not have enough clearance to even approach the Central Unit himself. Being a low-level commander at the time, he was relegated to waiting until final completion of the first find-and-rescue operation before initiating his own search mission.

Later on, Emi’s father was able to launch his own search and was indeed able to link back to Awki’s final code prints within the I. R. realm but a physical location could not be determined.

Awki had been working on Jump Immersive Reality v2.0 when he disappeared without a trace. 

Tragically, Awki was eventually found by control agents but his family was not immediately notified due to high security concerns. His lifeless body suspended in a secret compartment within his lab. His solar plexus still attached to a Jump line.

“Inventor of Jump Found with Self-inflicted Gunshot Wounds:  Investigation Pending.”

“Jump v2.0 Delayed Due to Tragic Death of Creator.”

Emi read news headlines aloud to herself over and over, but the content did not match what she believed in her heart. Awki would never leave unfinished projects abruptly, and  worse, he would never leave her behind in this way. 

Notes

﻿Their eyes sparkled with wonder as the warm gleam of iridescent lights illuminated their path. Gazing ahead they caught sight of a dream shimmering on the horizon. And they walked holding hands approaching the entrance to the Light. 

Eons ago the sunlight bathed the surface of the entire planet. Brilliant indigo auroras waved over the mountains while the mist of a distant waterfall gave way to rainbows high above the rocks. Blue whales swam on crystal oceans under the deep sky at dawn as hundreds of stars lighted the heavens above. 

On earth, the sun powered the force of the winds and oceans, fiery, awesome, its glow providing abundant subsistence to creatures large and small. Nothing escaped the overflowing energy that poured from the mighty star. 

Lush vegetation sprung to life everywhere. 

The light infused its glow onto every surface of our heavenly body. 

All beings were consciously in touch with the light twhose time and prosperity appeared boundless.

The glow of the light permeated every corner of our heavenly body creating music, powering the force of the winds and oceans, and providing abundant energy to all beings large and small.

Robert gazed at her across the river whose churning waters ran red with blood. On the far bank, the woman stood facing him, motionless, solemn, her face hidden by a shroud. In her hand she gripped a blue cloth, which she now raised in honor of the sea corpses at her feet. The smell of death hung everywhere.

Spirituality. The Bhagavad Gita. The Vedas. The Upanishads. There is a special spiritual current that flows through them, and it accompanies me wherever I go. I don’t consider myself religious in the traditional sense, but I recognize timeless wisdom when I see it, and I reread these ancient texts, these unfathomable pearls, every once in a while, gaining more with every reading. Those sages, seers and saints were in touch with something. Something that, in my opinion, transcends both organized religion and atheism. I’m grateful to have discovered their timeless truths, and they have helped me in the course of my life.
