One day, special agents from Command Control arrived at her father’s residence to inform him Awki was missing and a find-and-rescue operation had been launched. Emi’s father requested control agents to put him through the Central Unit to expedite the search. He repeatedly argued, to no avail, the search operation was disjointed and Command Control was short in resources not to mention out of jurisdiction in their execution. 

It was customary for control agents to call on the Central Unit when necessary but for various reasons this operation was restricted and Emi’s father did not have enough clearance to even approach the Central Unit himself. Being a low-level commander at the time, he was relegated to waiting until final completion of the first find-and-rescue operation before initiating his own search mission.

Later on, Emi’s father was able to launch his own search and was indeed able to link back to Awki’s final code prints within the I. R. realm but a physical location could not be determined.

Awki had been working on Jump Immersive Reality v2.0 when he disappeared without a trace. 

Tragically, Awki was eventually found by control agents but his family was not immediately notified due to high security concerns. His lifeless body suspended in a secret compartment within his lab. His solar plexus still attached to a Jump line.

“Inventor of Jump Found with Self-inflicted Gunshot Wounds:  Investigation Pending.”

“Jump v2.0 Delayed Due to Tragic Death of Creator.”

Emi read news headlines aloud to herself over and over, but the content did not match what she believed in her heart. Awki would never leave unfinished projects abruptly, and  worse, he would never leave her behind in this way.
