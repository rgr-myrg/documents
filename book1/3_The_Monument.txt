The new Memorial Monument soon became our most treasured and loved landmark. With all the renovations, new features, and media attention, it quickly turned into the most famous reminder of the grandiosity of our previous blue planet, and to this day, it is by far the most accurate representation of where we all had lived once upon a time. Memorial Monument was moved to a new location and is now proudly situated within Central Heights.

Central Heights is the largest historic neighborhood in Harbordotem, stretching easterly across the promenade and alongside narrow avenues. It is the oldest neighborhood in Harbordotem with roughly 5,000 residents.

One of the core characteristics of Central Heights is constant change, in fact, the entire neighborhood has been in continuous development since the early days. Despite unstoppable progress, tearing down the old and rebuilding the state-of-the-art structures seen today, there are many remarkably well preserved areas with historic buildings and winding streets which provide a sharp contrast to the daily hustle-and-bustle and high energy distinctive of this part of town.

Today, Central Heights straddles two quadrants of Harbordotem city, Northbridge and Southbridge, and a large portion of it is designated as the governing district of the entire city. Memorial Monument is tucked away and nestled among the high energy walls of government buildings. 

Visitors strolling by on foot often stop to admire the view and catch a high resolution glimpse of the world that once was. Anyone can jump in and interact with the immersive simulation but never directly experience the true beauty of our former world.
