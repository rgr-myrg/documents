Awki had been a highly respected architect, historian, and archeologist and part of the original team in charge of preserving and recreating milestones in human history complete with landscapes and important landmarks. His team had single-handedly architected and developed the ubiquitous Jump platform that brought amazing experiences to the new world.

“A fully immersive platform for experiencing Earth as never before.”

“Explore history from a totally personal perspective and discover first-hand the incredible sites and richness of the blue planet.”

“Jump Immersive Reality delivers the whole world within your reach.”

“Jump Anywhere.”

Jump v1.0 eventually achieved complete realism. Users could jump to a mod of their choice and immerse themselves into scenes indistinguishable from waking reality. It was the first simulation of its kind. Loaded with features that allowed users to interact with inhabitants of the simulation as if they were indeed real.

Fearing misuse the government restricted programming of scenes and mods only to those with top secret security clearance.
