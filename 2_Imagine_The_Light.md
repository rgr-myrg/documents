There was a time, long ago, when the sunlight bathed the surface of the entire landscape, when pristine lush vegetation sprung to life sprouting hope and prosperity all over the planet. The glow of the light permeated every corner of our heavenly body creating music, powering the force of the winds and oceans, and providing endless energy to all beings large and small.

Beautiful indigo lights waved over the mountains while the mist of a distant waterfall gave way to rainbows high above the rocks. Blue whales swam on crystal clear oceans under the deep sky at dawn. Hundreds of stars lighted the Heavens. All were consciously in touch with the Universe. Time and prosperity seemed boundless.

It must have taken hundreds of years before Huma eventually overpowered and conquered the land by blending day and night into darkness and consuming our memories for sustenance; in the process becoming stronger and stronger with each iteration. 

Many believed humanity itself summoned the archon to emerge from its shadowy state of suspended animation into the light of our world. Our technological advancements had blurred the boundaries between the natural and artificial and soon reached a point of no return. The veil between the world above and the frozen realms below would cave in and burst open as the shadow that came into being beneath the veil solidified into dense matter. 

In hindsight, humanity was willingly complicit in its own breakdown.

No one heeded the warning signs. With time our thinking became murky and confused. Our reasoning faltered. Our hopes for survival shattered into fragmented dreams as the pathogen affixed itself into the very core of our being changing us and human history forever. Our way of life had been under attack and yet no war had ever been declared.

No one could foresee how that which was touted as progress and limitless power would also become humanity’s pitfall and weakness. How easily and steadfastly promises of human transformation and evolutionary breakthrough could backfire and instead replicate themselves like viruses that gradually replace its host’s thoughts with their own - unbeknownst to the host. 

Such powers of deception in the end almost finished off humanity for good. After all, if all you believe is true, how can you deny your own thoughts and words?  Huma had systematically entered into our collective consciousness.
